# üìä Statistical Modeling and Analysis of Telemarketing Campaign for Bank Term Deposits  

## üìù Project Overview  
This project analyzes a telemarketing campaign by a Portuguese bank that aimed to promote **term deposits**, a fixed-interest investment product providing consistent income for the bank. The objective is to:  
- Predict customers most likely to subscribe to a term deposit.  
- Optimize outreach strategies for cost-effective and targeted telemarketing efforts.  
- Provide actionable insights for future campaigns.  

The analysis leverages **CRISP-DM methodology** and uses statistical models to explore key research questions about customer behavior and campaign effectiveness.

## üîç Research Questions and Models  

### 1. What factors significantly affect a customer‚Äôs likelihood of subscribing to a term deposit?  
**Model:** Logistic Regression  
**Method:** Analyze predictor variables (e.g., age, job, balance) to understand their impact on subscription probability.  

### 2. Is there a statistically significant difference in subscription rates across demographic groups?  
**Model:** Chi-Square Test for Independence  
**Method:** Evaluate categorical variables like job, education, and marital status to identify receptive demographic segments.  

### 3. How do previous campaign results impact current subscription rates?  
**Model:** Survival Analysis (Cox Proportional Hazards Model & Kaplan-Meier Analysis)  
**Method:** Investigate how variables like `pdays`: no_of_days_since_last_contact and `previous`: previous_no_of_contacts influence subscription rates over time.  

### 4. What is the optimal contact strategy in terms of frequency and timing?  
**Model:** Random Forest model  
**Method:** Assess the effect of variables like campaign timing and frequency on conversion likelihood.  

### 5. How can customers be segmented based on subscription likelihood?  
**Model:** Cluster Analysis (K-means & Hierarchical Clustering)  
**Method:** Group clients into clusters to design targeted marketing strategies.
